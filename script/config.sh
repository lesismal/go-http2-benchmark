# again without restarting servers that are already up on this machine.
#
# Two things differ from a single-node run. The client cannot stop a server it
# did not start, so every framework's server stays up for the whole run rather
# than being killed after its turn: stop them on the server node afterwards
# with script/killall.sh, and use BENCH_FRAMEWORKS below if the idle ones
# holding memory would disturb the framework being measured. And each node
# gives the whole machine to its own half, since there is no longer anything
# to divide it with; BENCH_SERVER_CPU_LIST and BENCH_CLIENT_CPU_LIST still
# pin it where a node shares its CPUs with something else.

#              with EER breaking a tie in BenchEcho and BenchMultiplex
#              (Connections samples no CPU, so it has none). The rate test
#              multiplexes requests at a rate the clients set rather than to

#   framework  the order FrameworkList in config/config.go lists them in,

#              same row in every table and across runs, whatever it scored, so
#              two reports can be diffed. Only the Go list reaches a report;
#              the frameworks array below decides what is built and run, and is
#              kept in the same order so that the two read alike
#
# In either order every ranked column - TPS, and EER - shows each row's share
# of the best in that column after it, the best being 100%, and carries [↓1]
# or [↓2] after its title for which key it is. Rows that tie keep the
# framework order between them, so two frameworks that scored the same - or a
# whole table from a benchmark that did not run, which leaves every row at
# zero - come out the same way on every run.
